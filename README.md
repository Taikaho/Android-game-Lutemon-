# Lutemon

Java-based school project focused on object-oriented programming and application structure.

## Purpose
This project was developed as part of LUT University's OOP course to practice building a larger Java application using object-oriented design and clear program structure.

## Key concepts
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Domain modeling and application logic
- Managing application state and behavior

## Technologies
- Java
- Git

## Project status
The coursework has been completed and has been graded with good grades.

## My learning
I implemented the application logic and structure myself.
Through this project I strengthened my understanding of object-oriented design and working with larger Java codebases.

## Project structure
- app/src/main/java/... – application logic
- app/src/main/res – resources
- gradle files – build configuration
